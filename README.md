# Human Crossing Backend

This is the backend repository for Human Crossing. You can find the frontend repository by searching frontend_mod5_project in my (@rrosenb12) GitHub profile.

To use this project, simply clone this repo to your local machine. Make sure you have access to PostgreSQL and run the following commands in your terminal:

1. rails db:create
2. rails db:migrate
3. rails db:seed

This will have you all set up with the necessary seeded data and table migrations. Run:

4. rails s

To start up your server and head on over to the frontend repository to get the rest!
*** Please have your backend running on localhost:3000 before continuing, however.
### To repeat: please have your backend running on localhost:3000 before continuing :)
